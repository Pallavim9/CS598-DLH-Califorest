### About
This repository contains the code we developed to reproduce the results found in the califorest paper. It includes not only the model and analysis of results, but also a sample MIMIC-III dataset for testing. 
### To run this code locally
Running this notebook file is extremely simple. Instructions are below:
1. Update the dataset path in `CS598_Califorest.ipynb` to match the dataset you'd like to use. 
    * We included the `Synthetic_MIMIC-III_Dataset.csv` file that we used to test our implementation so that you can replicate our results
2. Run the notebook. All dependencies should get installed as you run it.
